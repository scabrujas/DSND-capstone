### Installation
This project is implemented in Python:
  - Pandas - data pre-processing
  - Pyspark - data pre-processing and modelling 
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn - data visualization

### Problem Definition
Sparkify is a subscription-based music application such as Spotify or Pandora, as part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree program, we want to analyze and clean the data in order to implement a model to predict if a user downgrades their subscription or leaves the platform.

### Files
The Repo contains only the 'Sparkify.ipynb' notebook which is a result of working on 128MB 'mini_sparkify_event_data.json' dataset provided by Udacity.

### Results
The findings can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@scabrujas/predicting-users-churn-on-sparkify-804c4e4a74a).

### Improvements

- Feature Engineering: We can include more features to the model like Total listening time for each user, Time since Registration, Errors per user

- User Interface: I would suggest the addition of more features and the implementation of a UI.
